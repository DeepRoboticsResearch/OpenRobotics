  abstract = {Stochastic exp-concave optimization is an important primitive in machine learning that captures several fundamental problems, including linear regression, logistic regression and more. The exp-concavity property allows for fast convergence rates, as compared to general stochastic optimization.  However, current algorithms that attain such rates scale poorly with the dimension $n$ and run in time $O(n^4)$, even on very simple instances of the problem.  The question we pose is whether it is possible to obtain fast rates for exp-concave functions using more computationally-efficient algorithms. },
