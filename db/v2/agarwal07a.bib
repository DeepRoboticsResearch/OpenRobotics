  title = {Generalized Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling},
  abstract = {We consider the non-metric multidimensional scaling problem: given a set of dissimilarities $\Delta$, find an embedding whose inter-point Euclidean distances have the same ordering as $\Delta$. In this paper, we look at a generalization of this problem in which only a set of order relations of the form $d_{ij}$},
