  title = {A Framework for Probability Density Estimation},
  abstract = {The paper introduces a new framework for learning probability density functions. A theoretical analysis suggests that we can tailor a distribution for a class of tasks by training it to fit a small subsample. Experimental evidence is given to support the theoretical analysis.},
