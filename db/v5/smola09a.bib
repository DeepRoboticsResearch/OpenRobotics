  title = {Relative Novelty Detection},
  abstract = {Novelty detection is an important tool for unsupervised data  analysis. It relies on finding regions of low density within which  events are then flagged as novel. By design this is dependent on the  underlying measure of the space. In this paper we derive a  formulation which is able to address this problem by allowing for a  reference measure to be given in the form of a sample from an  alternate distribution. We show that this optimization problem can  be solved efficiently and that it works well in practice.},
