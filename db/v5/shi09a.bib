  title = {Hash Kernels},
  abstract = {We propose hashing to facilitate efficient kernels. This generalizes  previous work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute  the kernel matrix for data streams and sparse feature  spaces. Moreover, we give deviation bounds from the exact kernel  matrix. This has applications to estimation on strings and graphs.},
