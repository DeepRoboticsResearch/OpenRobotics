  title = {Locally Minimax Optimal Predictive Modeling with Bayesian Networks},
  abstract = {We propose an information-theoretic approach for predictive modeling  with Bayesian networks. Our approach is based on the minimax  optimal Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) distribution, motivated  by the MDL principle. In particular, we present a parameter learning  method which, together with a previously introduced NML-based model  selection criterion, provides a way to construct highly predictive  Bayesian network models from data. The method is parameter-free and  robust, unlike the currently popular Bayesian marginal likelihood  approach which has been shown to be sensitive to the choice of prior  hyperparameters. Empirical tests show that the proposed method  compares favorably with the Bayesian approach in predictive tasks.},
