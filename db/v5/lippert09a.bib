  title = {A kernel method for unsupervised structured network inference},
  abstract = {Network inference is the problem of inferring edges between a set of real-world objects, for instance, interactions between pairs of proteins in bioinformatics.  Current kernel-based approaches to this problem share a set of  common features:  (i) they are supervised and hence require labeled training data; (ii) edges in the network are treated as mutually independent  and hence topological properties are largely ignored; (iii) they lack a statistical interpretation.  We argue that these common assumptions are often  undesirable for network inference, and propose (i) an  unsupervised kernel method (ii) that takes the global structure of the  network into account and (iii) is statistically motivated.  We show that our approach can explain commonly used heuristics in statistical terms. In experiments on social networks, different variants of our method demonstrate appealing predictive performance.},
