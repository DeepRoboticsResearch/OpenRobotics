  abstract = {Second-price auctions with reserve play a critical role for    modern search engine and popular online sites since the revenue of   these companies often directly depends on the outcome of such   auctions. The choice of the reserve price is the main mechanism   through which the auction revenue can be influenced in these   electronic markets. We cast the problem of selecting the reserve   price to optimize revenue as a learning problem and present a full   theoretical analysis dealing with the complex properties of the   corresponding loss function (it is non-convex and discontinuous). We further give novel algorithms for solving this problem and report the results of encouraging experiments   demonstrating their effectiveness.},
