  abstract = {The Mass Volume (MV) curve is a visual  tool to evaluate the performance of a scoring  function with regard to its capacity to rank  data in the same order as the underlying den-  sity function. Anomaly ranking refers to the  unsupervised learning task which consists in  building a scoring function, based on unla-  beled data, with a MV curve as low as pos-  sible at any point. In this paper, it is proved  that, in the case where the data generat-  ing probability distribution has compact sup-  port, anomaly ranking is equivalent to (su-  pervised) bipartite ranking, where the goal is  to discriminate between the underlying prob-  ability distribution and the uniform distribu-  tion with same support. In this situation, the  MV curve can be then seen as a simple trans-  form of the corresponding ROC curve. Ex-  ploiting this view, we then show how to use  bipartite ranking algorithms, possibly com-  bined with random sampling, to solve the  MV curve minimization problem. Numeri-  cal experiments based on a variety of bipar-  tite ranking algorithms well-documented in  the literature are displayed in order to illus-  trate the relevance of our approach.},
