  title = {Exploiting tree-based variable importances to selectively identify relevant variables},
  abstract = {This paper  proposes a novel statistical  procedure based on
 permutation tests for extracting  a subset of truly relevant
 variables from  multivariate importance rankings  derived from
 tree-based supervised learning methods.  It shows also that the
 direct extension of the classical approach based on permutation
 tests for estimating false discovery rates of univariate variable
 scoring procedures does not extend very well to the case of
 multivariate tree-based importance measures.  },
