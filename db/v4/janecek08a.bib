  title = {On the Relationship Between Feature Selection and Classification Accuracy},
  abstract = {Dimensionality reduction and feature subset selection are two techniques for reducing the attribute space of a feature set,
which is an important component of both supervised and unsupervised classification or regression problems. While in feature subset selection a subset of the original attributes is extracted, dimensionality reduction in general produces linear combinations of the original attribute set.},
