  abstract = {Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models are popular tools for describing causal relationships and for guiding attempts to learn
them from data. They appear to supply a means of extracting causal conclusions from probabilistic conditional independence
properties inferred from purely observational data. I take a critical look at this enterprise, and suggest that it is in
need of more, and more explicit, methodological and philosophical justification than it typically receives.
In particular, I argue for the value of a clean separation between formal causal language and intuitive causal assumptions.},
