  title = {Gaussian Process Approximations of Stochastic Differential Equations},
  abstract = {Stochastic differential equations arise naturally in a range of
contexts, from financial to environmental modeling. Current solution
methods are limited in their representation of the posterior process
in the presence of data. In this work, we present a novel Gaussian
process approximation to the posterior measure},
