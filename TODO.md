# To Do

(In no particular order)

- [ ] Improve the docs for the system on GitHub (especially dependencies) so others can run it

- [ ] Prettify the pages that are generated

- [ ] Add the Google Scholar metadata to each paper page

- [ ] Add javascript to embed discussion on each paper page

- [ ] Document exactly how we want things like BibTeX entry identifiers to appear and other constraints on the BibTeX file

- [ ] Add some code to automate pushing the generated sites to the JMLR server
