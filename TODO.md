# To Do

## Bugs

- [X] Load only papers for given conference (Snapshotting not working)
      (Search path now built from conference ID)

- [X] Figure out why some entries are not imported correctly.
      (Wasn't closing file handle after writing entry)

## Improvements

- [X] Preprocess single BibTeX files into one-per-paper and add link to 
	  each's paper's BibTeX.

- [ ] Improve the docs for the system on GitHub (especially dependencies) 
      so others can run it

- [X] Prettify the pages that are generated

- [ ] Add the Google Scholar metadata to each paper page

- [ ] Add javascript to embed discussion on each paper page

- [X] Document exactly how we want things like BibTeX entry identifiers to 
      appear and other constraints on the BibTeX file

- [ ] Add some code to automate pushing the generated sites to the JMLR server
